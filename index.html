    <p>This is the A11y Rules Podcast Network. A collection of podcasts about accessibility and inclusion. <br /><br /> The word "A11y" is a numeronym of the word accessibility. A numeronym is when you take the first and last letters of a word, count how many letters are in between, and put them together. There are 11 letters between the first a and the last y. So we get a-11-y, or a11y. I wrote a bit more about <a href="{{ "/about/#numeronym" | relative_url }}">my choice of using a11y for my show name on the About page</a>.</p>

        <p>The state of accessibility on the web is abysmal. Of the top 1,000,000 websites, each page has <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors">an average of 57 accessibility defects having a notable impact on disabled end users</a>. Your website or web application probably presents barriers to your disabled clients and users.</p>
        <p>Good news: You can fix that!</p>
        <p>Fixing accessibility for your digital products will require work, and a shift in organization culture. It is not easy, and it doesn't happen overnight. Let me help you on your journey!</p>

Nic brought many things to my attention that I had not thought of before and moving forward I feel this session will improve my coding and accessibility practices dramatically.</blockquote>
