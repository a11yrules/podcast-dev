## Original podcast

There is a lot of information about how to make the web accessible. There isn’t so much information about the people working to make the web accessible. Over the years that I’ve been involved with web accessibility, I have met a lot of very interesting people. I wanted to learn more about them, and meet new people involved in one way or another with web accessibility.

The A11y Rules Podcast is the result of this desire.

## The Sound Bites

Hear it in their own words – disabled people talking about the barriers they encounter on the web. These episodes are typically 5 to 10 minutes. We cover topics that are often not spoken about much but that make a difference to disabled visitors to your site or users of your apps.

As someone told me recently: 

<blockquote>Once you hear it, you can't unhear it. Learning the real world impact of inaccessibility from disabled people reaffirmed the importance of accessibility.</blockquote>

## A11y Rules Podcast Network - name {numeronym}

The "word" Ally stands for accessibility. It is a numeric abbreviation, or numeronym. The idea is that you take the first and last letter of a word and count how many letters are in between. Accessibility has 11 characters between the A and the Y. So we get A-11-y. Or a11y. A11y is pronounced "accessibility".

There is controversy in both disability and digital accessibility communities about the use of the a11y numeronym. I can't argue against people who say it is not friendly. Some even say it's not accessible! And they have a point. [Jonathan Mosen goes as far as saying it is harmful](https://mosen.org/a11yharm/).

Originally, the numeronym started being used on Twitter (a long long time before that platform was known as X). At the time, we had a 140 character limit. Every character counted. It made a big difference being able to "shave" 11 characters. Talks of "it's not accessible", "it's not inclusive", or "it's harmful" started surfacing after I started this show in 2017. I was not aware of any significant controversy back then.

I won't change the name of the shows. They remain "The A11y Rules Podcast", or part of "The A11y Rules Podcast Network".

I also don't use the numeronym in communications or social media anymore.
